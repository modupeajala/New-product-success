# New-product-success
Using Machine learning to predict the success or failure of new products to be launched by Champion.
I successfully completed this project for HanesBrands at the National Champion Analytics Competition
Note: Data used in this project will not be available for public view.

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict a 13-week demand for Champions new products and identify if the products will succeed or fail online vs Bricks & Mortar and how soon success or failure can be spotted in order to make plans accordingly.
# Methodology
We will employ three different models:
1.	Seasonal Naive: This method is like the naive method but predicts the last observed value of the same season of the year. This method works for highly seasonal data like ours.
2.	ARIMA: ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. It is a forecasting technique that projects the future values of a series based entirely on its own inertia. Its main application is in the area of short-term forecasting.
3.	Long short-term memory (LSTM): This is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series.
